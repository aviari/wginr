this directory contains C sources for samtools and associated
utilities like bgzip, bam2baf and fasta2basta.

the samtools distribution has been slightly modified
(mostly cosmetic), please see CHANGES_AV and DIFF_AV
in htslib and samtools directories for changes.

most important changes are :


requirements
--------------

- a gcc compiler (tested with 6.4 to 8.2.0)
- a gnu compatible make (tested gmake 3.81)

also see below for other dependencies

to compile
--------------

$ make all 
$ make install

upon succesfull completion, binaries will be copied
to ../ports/<portname>/bin

other dependencies
--------------

Samtools and htslib have several optional dependencies, please
see htslib/INSTALL and samtools/INSTALL for a complete list.

Two of  them are BZ2 (libbz2) and LZMA (liblzma).
By default, we turn them off since they are not necessary
to our binaries. But keep in mind that the generated
binaries (e.g. bgzip) may not work with some CRAM files.

If you have these libraries (libbz2 and liblzma) already
installed on your system, then run 

make WITH_BZ2=yes WITH_LZMA=yes all
