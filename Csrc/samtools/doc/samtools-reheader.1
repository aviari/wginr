.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
samtools reheader
.RB [ -iP ]
.I in.header.sam in.bam

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Replace the header in
.I in.bam
with the header in
.IR in.header.sam .
This command is much faster than replacing the header with a
BAM\(->SAM\(->BAM conversion.

By default this command outputs the BAM or CRAM file to standard
output (stdout), but for CRAM format files it has the option to
perform an in-place edit, both reading and writing to the same file.
No validity checking is performed on the header, nor that it is suitable
to use with the sequence data itself.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B -P, --no-PG
Do not generate an @PG header line.
.TP 8
.B -i, --in-place
Perform the header edit in-place, if possible.  This only works on CRAM
files and only if there is sufficient room to store the new header.
The amount of space available will differ for each CRAM file.
